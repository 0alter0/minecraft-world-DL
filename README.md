# minecraft-world-DL
Minecraft server world downloads.
This isn't WHOLE worlds but it's usually spawns or important areas.

Depending how big and intersting a server is, you can also suggest servers WITH their IP.

# DISCLAIMER
Some servers will apear to have a lot of ores in the ground, this is usually because they use Anti-Xray.
Some servers may be laggy due to bots/NPCs.
Chests will NOT show loot.
At the end of the worlds, it'll just be a dropoff.

# Instalation
Simply download the zip file, go into your Minecraft instance, go into the files, go into saves, in the zip file, there will either be 1 folder or multiple items, if there is 1 folder, just drag that folder into the saves folder, if there are multiple items, make a new folder in your saves (you can name it whatever you want, as it will be your world name), then place all those items in that folder.

# minecraft-world-DL
Minecraft server world downloads.
This isn't WHOLE worlds but it's usually spawns or important areas.

Depending how big and intersting a server is, you can also suggest servers WITH their IP.

# DISCLAIMER
Some servers will apear to have a lot of ores in the ground, this is usually because they use Anti-Xray.
Some servers may be laggy due to bots/NPCs.
Chests will NOT show loot.
At the end of the worlds, it'll just be a dropoff.

# Instalation
Simply download the folder, go to your Minecraft instalation, go into the files of it, go into saves, and drop the folder.
